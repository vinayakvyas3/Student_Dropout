        <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>Education is the foundation of a prosperous and empowered society. Education plays a vital role in the development of a nation. However, dropout rates in Indian schools have been a major cause of concern for policymakers and educators. It is also a significant issue in many countries worldwide, especially in developing countries.</p>
        <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>The dropout rate is measured in terms of the percentage of students who leave school before completing their level/grade. It is a critical indicator of the effectiveness of the education system. The UDISE+ 2021-22 data reveals that the overall dropout rate in schools in India is 1.5 percent, which is lower than the previous yearâ€™s rate of 1.8 percent. However, the rate is still a concern, especially in certain states.</p>
        <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>The UDISE+ 2021-22 data shows that the dropout rate is highest at the secondary level (9-10) with 12.6 percent, followed by upper primary (6-8) with 3 percent and primary (1-5) with 1.5 percent. The data further reveals that the dropout rate is higher for girls than boys at all levels of education.</p>
        <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>The rate is slightly higher for upper primary students (Classes 6-8), with an average of 3 percent. However, the dropout rate for secondary school students (Classes 9-10) is significantly higher at 12.6 percent.</p>
